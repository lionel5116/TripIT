This is a SwiftUI project for getting back into SwiftUI Development
This is a 2022 SwiftUI project that I developed to get back into coding with SwiftUI. It was written in XCODE on my Mac. I originally developed it use as a mobile
application for tracking my travel details. The backend of the application is using Realm DB local.
